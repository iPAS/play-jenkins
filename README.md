# Jenkins for CI/CD on Hardware Development

In this project, I learn to play with Jenkins, CI/CD automation server.


## Scenario

* The Jenkins server would be run at my computer.
* Everytime, files in directory 'build-me' are changed, committed, and pushed;
    the server will be acknowledged through Github Action.
* Then, the new source code will be downloaded, and compiled for testing.
